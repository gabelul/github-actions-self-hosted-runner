## [2.2.3] - 2025-09-27

### Fixed
- **üîê Enhanced Token Encryption**: Implemented OpenSSL AES-256-CBC encryption as primary method with XOR fallback
  - Fixed OpenSSL command syntax to use `aes-256-cbc` instead of `enc -aes-256-cbc`
  - Proper encryption/decryption flow with base64 encoding
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing XOR-encrypted tokens
- **üõ°Ô∏è Token Validation**: Added comprehensive token validation after decryption
  - Automatic detection and cleanup of corrupted tokens
  - Minimum length validation (20+ characters for GitHub tokens)
  - Token preview in debug output for troubleshooting
- **üîß Script Compatibility**: Fixed BASH_SOURCE parameter expansion issues
  - Proper handling when script is sourced vs executed directly
  - Prevents "parameter not set" errors in strict mode
- **üì± Function Structure**: Cleaned up decrypt_token function structure and removed duplicate code

### Security
- Token encryption now uses industry-standard AES-256-CBC with OpenSSL when available
- Fallback XOR encryption maintains compatibility with existing installations
- Enhanced error handling prevents token corruption issues

## [2.2.2] - 2025-09-27

### Fixed
- **üîÑ Workflow Migration Critical Fix**: Fixed bash arithmetic increment that caused migration to stop after first workflow
  - Replaced `((success_count++))` with `success_count=$((success_count + 1))` to avoid zero-evaluation exit code
  - Now properly processes all workflows instead of stopping after the first conversion
  - Affects both `migrate_workflows()` and `update_workflows()` functions

## [2.2.1] - 2025-09-26

### Fixed
- **üîß Token Encryption Issues**: Fixed XOR cipher NULL byte handling that caused token corruption
  - Replaced character-based XOR with hex-based implementation
  - All GitHub token formats now encrypt/decrypt correctly
- **üìÇ Temporary Directory Management**: All temporary files now use project directory instead of system `/tmp`
  - Created organized `.tmp/` structure with subdirectories for migrations, tests, backups, installs
  - Improved security and portability for all temporary operations
- **üîÑ Workflow Migration Fixes**: Fixed missing output redirection in workflow conversion
  - Workflow files now convert properly from GitHub-hosted to self-hosted runners
  - Fixed directory handling in migration process

### Changed
- All scripts now use project-based temporary directories for better organization
- Enhanced security with proper file permissions (700) for temp directories
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files older than 24 hours
