Have you ever hit your GitHub Actions limit and wondered "Why am I paying for this?" Well, you're in the right place! This tool lets you run GitHub Actions on your own computer or server instead of GitHub's expensive servers.

> ‚≠ê **Found this helpful?** Give us a star on GitHub! It helps other developers discover this tool and saves them money too!

**Think of it like this:** Instead of renting GitHub's kitchen to cook your meals (running your code), you're using your own kitchen. Same great meals, way less expensive!

## üÜï What's New in v2.2.1 - Stability & Fixes! üîß‚ú®

üéâ **Critical fixes for token handling and workflow migration!** Now more reliable than ever:

```bash
# Same great setup, now with fixes!
./setup.sh
```

**üîß Fixed in v2.2.1:**
- **Token Encryption**: Fixed NULL byte issues that corrupted GitHub tokens
- **Workflow Migration**: Fixed missing output in workflow conversion process
- **Temp Directories**: All temporary files now use project directory instead of system `/tmp`
- **Better Organization**: Cleaner `.tmp/` structure for migrations, tests, and backups

**üß† Smart Setup Wizard (ENHANCED!)**
- Detects existing runners first - no more redundant setup!
- Smart menu: manage existing vs add new runner
- Only asks for token when actually needed
- Auto-loads saved encrypted tokens

**üîß Enhanced Container Health**
- Fixed Docker health check timeouts
- New debug tool: `./scripts/debug-runner-health.sh`
- Comprehensive container diagnostics
- Automatic health issue detection

**üîÑ Supercharged Workflow Migration**
- `scan` command shows migration opportunities instantly
- `update` command migrates workflows with one command
- Real-time cost savings calculator
- Safe backups with easy rollback

> üí∞ **AI enthusiastically predicts savings of $50-200/month!** *(The math seems legit, but we'll let you be the judge)*

**üìö Full Details:** [Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md) | [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## ü§î Wait, What's This All About?

**The Problem:** GitHub Actions minutes cost money. If you use more than 2,000 minutes per month (that's about 33 hours), you start paying $0.008 per minute. That adds up fast!

**The Solution:** Run your GitHub Actions on your own computer or rented server. It's like having your own personal robot that tests your code for free.

## üëã Complete Beginner? Start Here!

Never done anything like this before? No problem! Here's what you need to know:

- **GitHub Actions** = Robots that test your code automatically when you make changes
- **Self-hosted runner** = Your own robot instead of GitHub's robot
- **VPS/Server** = A computer you rent online (like renting an apartment, but for computers)

**Why would you want this?**
- Save money (seriously, a lot of money)
- Your tests run faster (no waiting in line)
- You control everything

## ‚ú® What This Tool Does For You

## üöÄ Let's Get You Started!

### Quick Start (For the Impatient)

Got 5 minutes? Here's the fastest way to get running:

**üÜï Interactive Mode (Recommended):**
```bash
# Download and run the interactive wizard - it guides you through everything!
git clone https://github.com/gabel/github-self-hosted-runner.git
cd github-self-hosted-runner
./setup.sh  # Just run it! No flags needed!
```

**Classic Mode (If you know what you want):**
```bash
# Direct setup with your token and repository
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabel/github-self-hosted-runner/main/setup.sh | bash -s -- \
  --token ghp_your_personal_access_token_here \
  --repo owner/repository-name
```

**What happens?** The interactive wizard detects your GitHub CLI auth, shows your repositories, and guides you through the setup. It's like having a friendly expert helping you!

### I Want to Understand What I'm Doing

No problem! Here's the step-by-step way:

```bash
# Step 1: Download the code to your computer
git clone https://github.com/gabel/github-self-hosted-runner.git
cd github-self-hosted-runner

# Step 2: Run the setup (replace YOUR_TOKEN and owner/repository-name with your actual values)
./setup.sh --token YOUR_TOKEN --repo owner/repository-name

# Step 3: Check that it worked (you should see "active" in green)
sudo systemctl status github-runner
```

**What's happening here?**
1. We download the code to your computer
2. We run a script that sets everything up for your specific project
3. We check that the runner is actually working

### Wait, What's This Token Thing?

Great question! You need to get a "token" from GitHub first. Think of it like a password that lets this tool talk to your GitHub repository.

**How to get your token:**
1. Go to [GitHub Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "My Self-Hosted Runner"
4. Check the "repo" and "workflow" boxes
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (it starts with `ghp_`) - you'll need this!

### Prefer Docker? (For the Container Fans)

If you're already using Docker and want to keep everything in containers:

```bash
# Step 1: Go to the Docker folder
cd docker

# Step 2: Set up your configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Now edit the .env file and put in your GitHub token and repository

# Step 3: Start it up!
docker-compose up -d

# Step 4: Watch what's happening (press Ctrl+C to stop watching)
docker-compose logs -f github-runner
```

**What's Docker doing?** It's running your GitHub runner inside a container - like a little isolated box. This keeps everything clean and separated from your main system.

## üí° Real Examples (Copy & Paste Ready!)

### Just Getting Started

```bash
# Set up one runner for your main project
./setup.sh --token ghp_your_token_here --repo yourname/yourproject --name my-first-runner
```

**What this does:** Creates one runner that will handle all GitHub Actions for "yourproject"

### Multiple Projects on One Server

```bash
# Set up runners for different projects (save even more money!)
./setup.sh --token ghp_token1 --repo company/website --name website-runner
./setup.sh --token ghp_token2 --repo company/api --name api-runner
./setup.sh --token ghp_token3 --repo company/mobile-app --name mobile-runner
```

**What this does:** One server now handles GitHub Actions for three different projects. Triple the savings!

### Special Setups

```bash
# If you have a powerful GPU server for machine learning
./setup.sh \
  --token ghp_your_token \
  --repo yourname/ml-project \
  --name gpu-runner \
  --labels "self-hosted,linux,x64,gpu,cuda"
```

**What this does:** Creates a runner that your GitHub Actions can specifically target when they need GPU power

### Docker Examples

```bash
# Basic Docker setup
docker-compose up -d

# Run multiple projects in separate containers
RUNNER_NAME=project1-runner GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/project1 docker-compose --project-name project1 up -d
RUNNER_NAME=project2-runner GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/project2 docker-compose --project-name project2 up -d
```

**What this does:** Each project gets its own isolated container - super clean and organized

## üîß Managing Your Runners

### Basic Controls (Start, Stop, Check Status)

```bash
# Start all your runners
sudo systemctl start github-runner@*

# Stop one specific runner (replace "runner-name" with your actual runner name)
sudo systemctl stop github-runner@my-project-runner

# Check if a runner is working (should show "active" in green)
sudo systemctl status github-runner@my-project-runner

# See what your runner is doing right now (press Ctrl+C to stop watching)
sudo journalctl -u github-runner@my-project-runner -f
```

### Health Checks (Is Everything OK?)

```bash
# Quick check - are all runners healthy?
scripts/health-check.sh --all

# Detailed report for one specific runner
scripts/health-check.sh --runner my-project-runner --verbose

# How much CPU/memory are my runners using?
scripts/health-check.sh --resources
```

### Maintenance (Keeping Things Fresh)

```bash
# Update a runner to the latest version
scripts/update-runner.sh my-project-runner

# Clean up old stuff (keeps things running smoothly)
scripts/cleanup.sh --age 7

# Backup your runner settings (just in case!)
scripts/backup.sh --output ./backups/
```

## üîí We Keep You Safe

### Your Secrets Stay Secret
- **Secure token storage** - Your GitHub tokens are encrypted and protected
- **Limited access** - Each runner can only access the repositories you specify
- **Easy token updates** - Change your tokens anytime without breaking anything

### System Protection
- **Special user account** - Runners don't run as admin/root (much safer!)
- **Isolation** - Your runner jobs can't mess with your system files
- **Firewall setup** - Blocks unwanted network connections automatically
- **File protection** - Keeps runner files separate from your important stuff

### Always Watching (The Good Kind)
- **Activity logs** - We track what happens so you can see if anything goes wrong
- **Health monitoring** - Constantly checks that everything is working properly
- **Resource tracking** - Monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage so nothing gets overloaded
- **Security alerts** - Logs any suspicious activity for you to review

## üí∞ How Much Money Will You Save?

### What GitHub Currently Charges You

| Your Plan | Free Minutes Each Month | What You Pay for Extra Minutes | If You Use 4,000 Minutes/Month |
|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Free** | 2,000 minutes | $0.008 per minute | $16/month for extra 2,000 minutes |
| **Pro** | 3,000 minutes | $0.008 per minute | $8/month for extra 1,000 minutes |
| **Team** | 3,000 minutes | $0.008 per minute | $8/month for extra 1,000 minutes |

### What Your Own Server Costs

| Server Provider | What You Pay | What You Get | Like Getting This Many Minutes |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **DigitalOcean** | $12/month | 2 CPU, 2GB RAM | 1,500 GitHub minutes worth |
| **Linode** | $10/month | 2 CPU, 4GB RAM | 1,250 GitHub minutes worth |
| **AWS EC2** | $30/month | 2 CPU, 4GB RAM | 3,750 GitHub minutes worth |
| **Powerful Server** | $50/month | 8 CPU, 16GB RAM | 6,250 GitHub minutes worth |

### The Bottom Line

**You start saving money when you use more than about 1,250-1,500 GitHub minutes per month.**

**Real example:** If you're using 5,000 minutes per month on the Free plan:
- **GitHub's cost:** $24/month (2,000 free + $24 for 3,000 extra)
- **Your own server:** $12-15/month
- **You save:** $9-12/month ($108-144 per year!)

Plus your builds run faster and you never have to wait in queue!

> üí° **Hypothetical Success Story:** "An AI imagines you could save $65/month. We're pretty sure the math checks out, but we're also the ones who did the math, so... ü§∑" - *Your friendly neighborhood AI*

## üîÑ Automatic Workflow Migration (New!)

Got existing GitHub Actions workflows? Don't rewrite them manually! Our workflow helper automatically converts your workflows to use self-hosted runners.

### Quick Migration

```bash
# First, set up your self-hosted runner
./setup.sh --token ghp_your_token --repo owner/your-repo

# Then migrate your workflows automatically
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh migrate /path/to/your-repository
```

**What happens?** The tool will:
1. üìã Show you all your current workflows
2. ‚úÖ Let you pick which ones to migrate (with checkboxes!)
3. üíæ Create backups of your original workflows
4. üîÑ Convert `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` to `runs-on: self-hosted`
5. üí∞ Tell you how much money you'll save

### Integrated Workflow Management (‚≠ê NEW!)

# ‚Üí See workflow analysis for each repository
# ‚Üí Migrate workflows directly from the management interface!
```

**üéØ Smart workflow analysis shows you:**
- ‚úÖ Which workflows are already using self-hosted runners
- ‚ùå Which workflows are still using GitHub-hosted runners (costing money!)
- üí∞ Exact cost savings potential per repository (e.g., "~$3.20/month saved")
- üîÑ One-click migration for unconverted workflows
- ‚ö° **Lightning fast** - Uses GitHub API instead of cloning repositories

**üöÄ Migration options:**
- **Migrate all workflows** - Convert everything in one go
- **Select specific workflows** - Choose exactly which ones to convert
- **Preview changes first** - See what will change before applying
- **Safe with backups** - Automatic backups with easy rollback

**‚ö° API-Based Analysis (NEW!):**
- **No cloning needed** - Analyzes workflows via GitHub API only
- **Works everywhere** - Requires only GitHub CLI or curl (no git needed)
- **Lightning fast** - Especially for large repositories
- **Less disk space** - No temporary repository copies
- **Smart authentication** - Uses your existing GitHub CLI login or prompts for token
- **Real-time data** - Always analyzes the latest workflow versions

### See What You'll Save

```bash
# Analyze your repository without making changes
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh analyze /path/to/your-repository

./scripts/workflow-helper.sh analyze ~/my-project

# Output: Found 5 workflows, 3 using GitHub runners
# Potential savings: $18/month

# Step 2: Migrate interactively
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh migrate ~/my-project

# You'll see:
# ‚úÖ 1. ci.yml (currently: ubuntu-latest)
# ‚úÖ 2. tests.yml (currently: ubuntu-latest)
# ‚ùå 3. windows-build.yml (currently: windows-latest)
# ‚úÖ 4. deploy.yml (currently: ubuntu-latest)
# ‚ùå 5. security.yml (currently: ubuntu-latest)

# Select: [a]ll, [n]one, [3] toggle, [d]one
