# 🎉 GitHub Self-Hosted Runner v2.0.0 - Interactive Magic Release

**The easiest way to set up GitHub Actions self-hosted runners just got even easier!**

## 🌟 What's New in v2.0.0

### 🧙‍♂️ Interactive Setup Wizard
**No more command-line confusion!** Just run `./setup.sh` and follow the friendly prompts:

```bash
# Before (v1.x): Remember all the flags 😅
./setup.sh --token ghp_xxx --repo owner/repo --name runner-1

# Now (v2.0): Just run and follow the wizard! ✨
./setup.sh
```

**What the wizard does for you:**
- 🔍 **Auto-detects GitHub CLI** - If you've already done `gh auth login`, we'll use that!
- 📋 **Shows your repositories** - Pick from a list instead of typing
- ⚙️ **Guides installation choice** - Docker vs Native with clear explanations
- 📊 **Configuration summary** - Review before proceeding

### 🔄 Supercharged Workflow Migration
**Stop paying for GitHub Actions minutes!** Our workflow migration system is now incredibly smart:

#### New Commands:
```bash
# Quick scan - see what you can migrate
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh scan

# Found: 3 workflows using GitHub-hosted runners
# Potential savings: ~$24/month

# One-click migration (with backups!)
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh update /path/to/repo
```

#### What Makes It Special:
- 🎯 **Smart Detection** - Finds workflows anywhere in your project structure
- 💾 **Safe Backups** - Timestamped backups with easy rollback
- 💰 **Cost Calculator** - See exactly how much you'll save
- ⚡ **Bulk Operations** - Migrate multiple workflows at once

### 🧪 Integrated Testing Flow
**Never wonder if your setup worked!** After installation, the system offers to test everything:

```
✨ GitHub Self-Hosted Runner Setup Complete!

🧪 Test Your Runner Setup
Would you like to test your runner setup? [Y/n]: y

✅ Runner validation completed successfully!

🔄 Migrate Existing Workflows
Found 2 workflow(s) using GitHub-hosted runners
Migrate workflows to use self-hosted runners? [y/N]: y
```

**The complete flow:** Setup → Test → Migrate → Save Money! 💰

## 🆕 New Workflow Templates

Six production-ready templates that work out-of-the-box with self-hosted runners:

- **🟢 Node.js CI** - Testing, linting, security scanning
- **🐍 Python CI** - Multi-version testing, coverage reports
- **🐳 Docker Build** - Multi-arch builds with security scanning
- **🚀 Production Deploy** - Blue-green deployments with approval gates
- **🧪 Matrix Testing** - Cross-platform testing grids
- **🔒 Security Scan** - Comprehensive security analysis

Generate them with: `./scripts/workflow-helper.sh generate`
