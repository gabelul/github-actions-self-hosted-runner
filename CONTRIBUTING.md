# Want to Help? We'd Love That! üéâ

Hey there! Thanks for thinking about contributing to our GitHub runner project. Whether you're a coding wizard or someone who's never contributed to open source before, we're excited you're here!

**First time contributing to open source?** Perfect! We wrote this guide specifically for people like you. Don't worry - we've all been beginners, and the community is super friendly and helpful.

## ü§î What Even Is This Project?

This project helps people run GitHub Actions on their own servers instead of paying GitHub's expensive prices. Think of it like this:

- **GitHub's way:** Rent their kitchen to cook your meals (expensive)
- **Our way:** Use your own kitchen to cook the same meals (way cheaper!)

We built this because we got tired of paying so much for GitHub Actions minutes. Now thousands of developers save money with it!

## üëã Never Done This Before? Start Here!

Don't worry about having everything figured out. Here's what you need to know:

### What You'll Need
- A computer (Mac, Windows with WSL, or Linux)
- Basic comfort with the command line (we'll help you!)
- A GitHub account
- Willingness to learn (most important!)

**Don't have these technical skills yet?**
- GitHub Actions workflows ‚Üê We'll teach you
- Linux commands ‚Üê We'll show you what you need
- Shell scripting ‚Üê You can learn as you go
- Docker ‚Üê Only needed for some contributions

### Your First Day Setup

1. **Get Your Own Copy**
   ```bash
   # Fork the project on GitHub first (big green button), then:
   git clone https://github.com/gabelul/github-self-hosted-runner.git
   cd github-self-hosted-runner
   ```

2. **Look Around**
   ```bash
   # Take a look at what we've built
   ls -la

   # Read about how everything works (optional but interesting!)
   cat CLAUDE.md
   ```

3. **Test That Everything Works**
   ```bash
   # Make sure our tests pass on your computer
   ./scripts/test-suite.sh --check-environment

   # Run some basic tests (don't worry if you don't understand them yet)
   ./scripts/test-suite.sh --unit-tests
   ```

**Stuck already?** No worries! [Open an issue](../../issues) and tell us where you got stuck. We love helping newcomers!

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

#### Shell Script Standards

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# File header with description and usage
# GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Runner - [Script Purpose]
#
# Brief description of what this script does
#
# Usage:
#   ./script.sh [OPTIONS]

set -euo pipefail  # Always use strict mode

# Use readonly for constants
readonly SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
readonly VERSION="1.0.0"

# Use descriptive variable names
GITHUB_TOKEN=""
REPOSITORY_NAME=""
RUNNER_INSTANCE_NAME=""

# Function naming: verb_noun or action_target
configure_runner() {
    local token="$1"
    local repo="$2"

    # Validate inputs
    if [[ -z "$token" ]]; then
        log_error "GitHub token is required"
        return 1
    fi

    # Implementation
}

# Always include help function
show_help() {
    cat << EOF
Script Name - Brief Description

USAGE:
    $0 [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    --option VALUE    Description
    --help           Show this help

EXAMPLES:
    $0 --option value
EOF
}
```

#### Documentation Standards

- **Comments**: Explain the "why", not the "what"
- **Function headers**: Document parameters and return values
- **Complex logic**: Add inline comments for clarity
- **Examples**: Provide usage examples in help text

#### Security Standards

```bash
# ‚úÖ GOOD - Secure practices
validate_input() {
    local input="$1"

    # Input validation
    if [[ ! "$input" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$ ]]; then
        log_error "Invalid input format"
        return 1
    fi
}

# Secure file operations
sudo -u github-runner mkdir -p "$SECURE_DIR"
sudo -u github-runner chmod 700 "$SECURE_DIR"

# ‚ùå BAD - Security anti-patterns
# Don't do these:
eval "$user_input"  # Command injection risk
cp "$user_file" /system/  # Path traversal risk
echo "$token" > /tmp/token  # Insecure storage
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Testing

```bash
# Test functions in isolation
test_validate_github_token() {
    # Test valid token
    if validate_github_token "ghp_valid_token_format_here"; then
        echo "‚úÖ Valid token test passed"
    else
        echo "‚ùå Valid token test failed"
        return 1
    fi

    # Test invalid token
    if ! validate_github_token "invalid_token"; then
        echo "‚úÖ Invalid token test passed"
    else
        echo "‚ùå Invalid token test failed"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

#### Integration Testing

```bash
# Test complete workflows
test_full_runner_setup() {
    local test_token="$1"
    local test_repo="$2"

    # Setup test environment
    local test_dir="/tmp/runner-test-$$"
    mkdir -p "$test_dir"

    # Run setup process
    if ./setup.sh --token "$test_token" --repo "$test_repo" --install-dir "$test_dir"; then
        echo "‚úÖ Integration test passed"
        cleanup_test_environment "$test_dir"
        return 0
    else
        echo "‚ùå Integration test failed"
        cleanup_test_environment "$test_dir"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

#### Platform Testing

Test across different environments:

- **Ubuntu 20.04/22.04** (Primary support)
- **Debian 11/12** (Secondary support)
- **CentOS 8 / Rocky Linux** (Enterprise support)
- **macOS** (Local development)
- **Docker containers** (Containerized deployment)

### Documentation Guidelines

#### README Updates

When adding features, update:

test_malicious_inputs() {
    local malicious_inputs=(
        "../../etc/passwd"
        "\$(rm -rf /)"
        "; cat /etc/shadow"
        "../../../../../etc/hosts"
    )

    for input in "${malicious_inputs[@]}"; do
        if validate_input "$input"; then
            echo "‚ùå Security test failed for: $input"
            return 1
        fi
    done

    echo "‚úÖ Security tests passed"
}
```
