**Use Standalone Scripts When:**
- You want to automate migration in scripts
- You're working with local repository clones
- You need advanced customization options
- You're integrating with CI/CD systems

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Setup Your Self-Hosted Runner

First, ensure you have a working self-hosted runner:

```bash
./setup.sh --token ghp_your_token --repo owner/your-repo
```

### 2. Analyze Your Repository

See what workflows you have and potential savings:

```bash
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh analyze /path/to/your/repository
```

### 3. Migrate Your Workflows

Convert existing workflows to use self-hosted runners:

```bash
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh migrate /path/to/your/repository
```

### 4. Generate New Workflows

Create new workflows from templates:

```bash
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh generate
```

## üìã Available Commands

### `analyze` - Repository Analysis

Analyzes your repository's GitHub Actions usage and calculates migration potential.

```bash
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh analyze <repo_path> [options]

name: Infrastructure Update
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday

jobs:
  migrate-workflows:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Update workflow configurations
        run: |
          for repo in $(find /repos -name ".github" -type d); do
            repo_root=$(dirname "$repo")
            ./scripts/workflow-helper.sh analyze "$repo_root"
          done
```

### Custom Templates

Create your own workflow templates:

1. **Create Template File**
   ```bash
   # Create new template
   touch scripts/workflow-templates/my-custom.yml.template
   ```

2. **Template Format**
   ```yaml
   # Description: Your custom workflow description

   name: Custom Workflow

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]

   jobs:
     custom:
       runs-on: self-hosted
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - name: Custom step
           run: echo "Custom logic here"
   ```

3. **Use Custom Template**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/workflow-helper.sh template my-custom
   ```

## üìä Cost Analysis Deep Dive

### Understanding the Analysis

The cost analysis considers:

1. **Current Usage Patterns**
   - Number of GitHub-hosted workflows
   - Estimated minutes per workflow
   - GitHub Actions pricing tiers

2. **Migration Potential**
   - Workflows that can be migrated
   - Workflows that should stay on GitHub (Windows, macOS)
   - Complex workflows requiring manual review

3. **Savings Calculation**
   ```
   Monthly Savings = (Migrated Workflows √ó Minutes/Workflow √ó $0.008) - Server Cost
   ```

### Example Calculations

**Scenario 1: Small Project**
- 3 workflows using ubuntu-latest
- ~100 minutes/month total
- Current cost: $0.80/month
- Self-hosted cost: $12/month VPS
- **Result**: Not cost-effective (break-even at ~1,500 minutes)

**Scenario 2: Active Development**
- 8 workflows using ubuntu-latest
- ~2,000 minutes/month total
- Current cost: $16/month
- Self-hosted cost: $12/month VPS
- **Result**: Save $4/month ($48/year)

**Scenario 3: Enterprise Usage**
- 15 workflows using ubuntu-latest
- ~5,000 minutes/month total
- Current cost: $40/month
- Self-hosted cost: $20/month powerful VPS
- **Result**: Save $20/month ($240/year)

## üîí Security Considerations

### Safe Migration Practices

1. **Always Create Backups**
   ```bash
   # Backups are created by default
   ./scripts/workflow-helper.sh migrate /path/to/repo

   # Skip backups only if absolutely necessary
   ./scripts/workflow-helper.sh migrate /path/to/repo --no-backup
   ```

2. **Test Before Production**
   ```bash
   # Use dry-run to preview changes
   ./scripts/workflow-helper.sh migrate /path/to/repo --dry-run
   ```

3. **Gradual Migration**
   ```bash
   # Migrate non-critical workflows first
   # Test thoroughly
   # Then migrate critical production workflows
   ```

### Security Template Usage

The security scanning template includes:

- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog, GitLeaks
- **Dependency Scanning**: Snyk, npm audit
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint security rules, Semgrep
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Docker Bench
- **Compliance**: License checking, policy validation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Migration Failures

**Problem**: Migration fails with "file not found"
```bash
Error: No .github/workflows directory found
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure you're in the correct repository directory
cd /path/to/your/repository
ls -la .github/workflows/

# Or provide absolute path
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh migrate /full/path/to/repository
```

#### Interactive Selection Issues

**Problem**: Selection interface not responding

**Solution**:
```bash
# Use non-interactive mode
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh migrate /path/to/repo --force

# Or use dry-run first
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh migrate /path/to/repo --dry-run
```

#### Template Generation Errors

**Problem**: Template generation fails

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check templates directory exists
ls -la scripts/workflow-templates/

# Verify template file permissions
chmod +r scripts/workflow-templates/*.template

# Use verbose mode for debugging
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh generate --verbose
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Tool Help**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/workflow-helper.sh --help
   ```

2. **Enable Verbose Output**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/workflow-helper.sh migrate /path/to/repo --verbose
   ```

3. **Check Logs**
   ```bash
   # Migration logs
   tail -f ~/.github-runner-backups/migration.log

   # Runner logs
   journalctl -u github-runner -f
   ```

4. **Rollback if Needed**
   ```bash
   # Find backup directory
   ls -la ~/.github-runner-backups/

   # Restore from backup
   cp ~/.github-runner-backups/TIMESTAMP/*.backup .github/workflows/
   ```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Pre-Migration

1. **Test Your Self-Hosted Runner**
   ```bash
   # Ensure runner is active and working
   systemctl status github-runner
   ```

2. **Analyze Repository Thoroughly**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/workflow-helper.sh analyze /path/to/repo
   ```

3. **Review Complex Workflows Manually**
   - Matrix strategies
   - Multi-OS workflows
   - Workflows with special requirements

### During Migration

1. **Start Small**
   - Migrate one workflow at a time initially
   - Test each migration thoroughly
   - Build confidence before bulk migration

2. **Use Dry Run**
   ```bash
   # Always preview changes first
   ./scripts/workflow-helper.sh migrate /path/to/repo --dry-run
   ```

3. **Keep Backups**
   - Don't use `--no-backup` unless necessary
   - Verify backup creation before proceeding

### Post-Migration

1. **Test All Workflows**
   ```bash
   # Trigger workflows manually to test
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Test self-hosted runner"
   git push
   ```

2. **Monitor Performance**
   ```bash
   # Check runner health
   ./scripts/health-check-runner.sh

   # Monitor resource usage
   htop
   ```

3. **Document Changes**
   - Update team documentation
   - Document any custom configurations
   - Share migration results with team

### Template Usage

1. **Customize Templates**
   - Review generated workflows
   - Adjust for your specific needs
   - Add project-specific steps

2. **Version Management**
   - Pin action versions for stability
   - Update actions regularly for security
   - Test action updates in non-production first

3. **Resource Planning**
   - Configure appropriate runner labels
   - Plan for concurrent job limits
   - Monitor resource usage patterns

## üìà Monitoring and Optimization

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Check workflow execution times
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh analyze /path/to/repo --performance

# Monitor system resources
./scripts/health-check-runner.sh --detailed

# Check runner queue status
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh status
```

### Cost Optimization

```bash
# Regular cost analysis
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh analyze /path/to/repo --cost-report

# Identify optimization opportunities
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh optimize /path/to/repo
```

### Maintenance

```bash
# Update workflow templates
./scripts/workflow-helper.sh update-templates

# Clean up old backups
find ~/.github-runner-backups -mtime +30 -delete

# Update runner software
./scripts/update-runner.sh
```
